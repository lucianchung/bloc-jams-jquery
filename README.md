This was a student project in which I used jQuery to build a music player app.

JQuery was used to:
* display information like Album Name, Artist, Song Names, etc
* give functionality to Play, Pause, Next Song, and Previous Song buttons
* display Current Time and Total Time for song currently playing
* give functionality to slider to let user choose where in the song they want to play
